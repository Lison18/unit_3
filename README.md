## Criteria A: Planning

## Problem definition

The client called Verlon wants an aplication to record his new IB grades each quarter. Verlon wants to be aware of his progresses and demand to know which grades are bellow the average by having a reminder. Furthermore, he will be able to know which subjetcs he has to work the most in order to reach his best score to go to his dream university in the United States.To achive this dream, he will have to improve his results by increasing his study organization thanks to a schedule of all the tasks that has to be done. For that, he wants to be abke to brainstorm by using some quick notes as reminders. Thanks to this aplication, Verlon will be updated if he is on track on all of his subjects or not.

## Success Criteria


1. The application has to provide a login system demanding the username, email and password in order to sign up
2. The application has to allow the user to input all his grades in IB
3. The application has to provide a system which finds the grades bellow the average 
4. The application has to provide an alarm message when the grade is very low and a positive one when the grade is high 
5. The application has to show a motivating quote each time the customer sign up 
6. The application has to be able to calculate the average for each subjects and the total IB score of the customer out of 45.

# Criteria B: Design

## System Diagram **SL**
![](sysdim_sl.png)

**Fig.1** shows the system diagram for the proposed solution (**SL**). The indoor variables will be measured using an Arduino microprocessor and the sensor DHT11 conencted to the local computer (Laptop) located inside a room. The outdoor variables will be requested to the remote server using a GET request to the API of the server at ```192.168.6.147/readings```. The local values are stored in a CSV database locally.

**Fig.2** shows the system diagram for the proposed solution (**HL**). The indoor variables will be measured using a Raspberry PI and four DHT11 sensors located inside a room. Four sensors are used to determine more precisely the physical values and include measurement uncertainty. The outdoor variables will be requested to the remote server using a GET request to the API of the server at ```192.168.6.147/readings```. The local values are stored in a CSV database locally and POST to the server using the API and TOKEN authentication. A laptop computer is used for remotely controlling the local Rasberry Pi using a Dekptop sharing application (VNC Viewer). (Optional) Data from the local raspberry is downloaded to the laptop for analysis and processing.
